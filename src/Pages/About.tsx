                I'm the heart and soul behind Flavor Lab—where spices meet creativity! 🍛✨
                Cooking has always been my passion, and nothing makes me happier than bringing authentic Indian flavors to your plate. From rich, slow-cooked curries to crispy, golden dosas, I love experimenting with traditional recipes while keeping their original soul intact.
                At Flavor Lab, every dish is made with love, fresh ingredients, and a touch of home. Whether you're a fan of spicy street food, comforting home-cooked meals, or something totally unique, I’m here to serve up flavors that’ll keep you coming back for more!
                So, pull up a chair, grab a plate, and let’s take a delicious journey through India—one bite at a time!
